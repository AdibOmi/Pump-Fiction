# Profile Page Data Loading Fix

## Problem Identified
The profile page was not displaying existing user data (name, email, etc.) from the backend API.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the profile page's data loading mechanism:

1. **Timing Issue**: The `_loadProfileData` function was called inside `addPostFrameCallback` with a fragile condition
2. **State Management**: The condition checked if `fullNameController.text.isEmpty`, which could fail on widget rebuilds
3. **No Tracking**: There was no way to track if data had already been loaded, causing potential multiple loads or no loads

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Data Loading State Tracking
```dart
bool _isDataLoaded = false; // Track if data has been loaded
```

### 2. Updated `_loadProfileData` Method
- Added check for `_isDataLoaded` flag to prevent duplicate loads
- Wrapped all state updates in `setState()` for proper UI refresh
- Added debug logging to track data flow

### 3. Improved Data Loading Trigger
Changed from:
```dart
WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
  if (profile != null && fullNameController.text.isEmpty) {
    _loadProfileData(profile);
  }
});
```

To:
```dart
if (profile != null && !_isDataLoaded) {
  Future.microtask(() => _loadProfileData(profile));
}
```

### 4. Added Debug Logging
Added comprehensive logging throughout the data flow:
- **Repository**: Logs API calls, responses, and errors
- **Provider**: Logs profile fetching and results
- **UI**: Logs when data is loaded into form fields

## How the Data Flow Works

1. **User opens Profile Page**
2. **Provider (`userProfileProvider`) initializes**
   - Calls `UserProfileRepository.getProfile()`
3. **Repository makes API call**
   - GET request to `/profile/me`
   - Auth token automatically added by `AuthInterceptor`
4. **Backend returns profile data**
   - Includes: id, user_id, email, full_name, phone_number, etc.
5. **Data is parsed into `UserProfileModel`**
6. **Provider returns data to UI**
7. **Profile Page detects new data**
   - Calls `_loadProfileData()` via `Future.microtask`
8. **UI fields are populated**
   - TextControllers updated with values
   - Dropdown values set
   - `_isDataLoaded` flag set to true

## Testing Steps

### 1. Check Backend API
Ensure the backend is running and the profile endpoint works:
```bash
cd backend
python -m app.main
```

### 2. Test Profile API Directly
If logged in, you can test the endpoint:
- Check network logs in VS Code Debug Console
- Look for API calls to `/profile/me`

### 3. Run the Flutter App
```bash
cd frontend
flutter run
```

### 4. Monitor Debug Logs
When navigating to the profile page, you should see:
```
üì± Fetching user profile...
üîç Calling API: /profile/me
‚úÖ API Response Status: 200
‚úÖ API Response Data: {...}
‚úÖ Profile parsed successfully: user@example.com
üì± Profile fetched: user@example.com, John Doe
üîÑ Loading profile data into UI...
   Email: user@example.com
   Full Name: John Doe
   Phone: +1234567890
‚úÖ Profile data loaded into UI successfully
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. ‚úÖ When user opens profile page, existing data loads automatically
2. ‚úÖ Email field shows the user's email (read-only)
3. ‚úÖ Name field shows the user's full name if it exists
4. ‚úÖ Phone, weight, height, and other fields populate if data exists
5. ‚úÖ Dropdowns (gender, fitness goal, etc.) are pre-selected if values exist
6. ‚úÖ User can edit and save changes

## If Issues Persist

### Check Authentication
```dart
// In Flutter DevTools or logs, verify:
// 1. Access token is stored
// 2. Auth interceptor is adding token to requests
```

### Check Backend Profile Creation
The backend automatically creates an empty profile if it doesn't exist:
```python
# In user_profile_controller.py
if not profile:
    profile = await service.create_profile(user_id, {})
```

### Verify Profile Model Mapping
Ensure JSON keys match between backend and frontend:
- Backend uses snake_case: `full_name`, `phone_number`
- Frontend model uses `@JsonKey` annotations to map correctly

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Profile returns null
**Solution**: Check if user is authenticated and token is valid

### Issue: Fields still empty after loading
**Solution**: Check debug logs - data might not be in the database yet

### Issue: Only email shows, nothing else
**Solution**: This is expected if profile was just created - other fields are optional

### Issue: Data loads but disappears on edit
**Solution**: Make sure you're not overwriting controller text after user edits

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/profile_page.dart`
   - Added `_isDataLoaded` flag
   - Updated `_loadProfileData` method
   - Changed data loading trigger mechanism
   - Added debug logging

2. `frontend/lib/features/profile/presentation/providers/profile_providers.dart`
   - Added debug logging to track profile fetching

3. `frontend/lib/features/profile/data/repositories/user_profile_repository.dart`
   - Added comprehensive debug logging for API calls

## Next Steps

After verifying the fix works:
1. Remove or reduce debug logging (change to proper logging framework)
2. Add error handling UI feedback
3. Add loading indicators during data fetch
4. Consider adding pull-to-refresh functionality
