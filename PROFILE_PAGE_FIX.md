# Profile Page Fix - Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary
The profile page was showing empty fields even though user data existed in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Wrong API Endpoint ‚ùå
**Frontend was calling:** `/profile/me`  
**Backend actually had:** `/users/me/profile`  

The backend had TWO conflicting endpoints:
1. `user_controller.py` - Basic endpoint at `/users/me/profile` (simple user info)
2. `user_profile_controller.py` - Full endpoint at `/profile/me` (complete profile with fitness data)

FastAPI was matching the first endpoint, which returned basic user info but NOT in the format the frontend expected.

### Issue 2: Endpoint Conflict üî¥
The `user_controller.py` had a basic `/users/me/profile` endpoint that returned:
```python
{
    "id": ...,
    "email": ...,
    "full_name": ...,
    "role": ...
}
```

But the `user_profile_controller.py` endpoint returned the FULL profile:
```python
{
    "id": ...,
    "user_id": ...,
    "email": ...,           # from JOIN with users table
    "full_name": ...,
    "phone_number": ...,
    "gender": ...,
    "weight_kg": ...,
    "height_cm": ...,
    "fitness_goal": ...,
    "experience_level": ...,
    "training_frequency": ...,
    "nutrition_goal": ...
}
```

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Backend Routes
- **Changed** `user_profile_controller.py` prefix from `/profile` to `/users`
- **Changed** routes from `/me` to `/me/profile`
- **Removed** the conflicting basic endpoint from `user_controller.py`

Now the proper endpoint is: **`GET /users/me/profile`**

### 2. ‚úÖ Frontend Already Fixed
- API constant already updated to `/users/me/profile`

### 3. ‚úÖ Added Edit Mode Functionality
- Added `_isEditMode` state variable
- **Edit Button**: Click to enable editing of fields
- **Save Button**: Click to save changes and exit edit mode
- Fields are read-only until "Edit" is clicked
- Email field is ALWAYS read-only (can't be changed)

## Database Schema (No Changes Needed)

The database schema is correct:
- `users` table has `email`, `full_name`, `phone_number`
- `user_profiles` table references `users` via foreign key
- Backend does JOIN to get email in the profile response
- Auto-create trigger exists to create profile when user signs up

## Testing

1. Backend server running on `http://localhost:8000`
2. Frontend connects to `http://10.0.2.2:8000` (Android emulator)
3. Endpoint: `GET /users/me/profile` returns full profile with email
4. User: capablemann4dwin@gmail.com (Ahmed Shafin Ruhan)

## Files Modified

### Backend:
1. `backend/app/controllers/user_profile_controller.py`
   - Changed prefix to `/users`
   - Changed routes to `/me/profile`
   
2. `backend/app/controllers/user_controller.py`
   - Removed conflicting `/me/profile` endpoint

### Frontend:
1. `frontend/lib/core/constants/api_constants.dart`
   - Updated `userProfile` to `/users/me/profile`
   
2. `frontend/lib/features/profile/presentation/pages/profile_page.dart`
   - Added edit mode functionality
   - Button toggles between "Edit Profile" and "Save Profile"
   - Fields disabled until edit mode is enabled

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Backend will auto-reload with new routes
2. ‚úÖ Frontend hot reload to apply changes
3. ‚úÖ Test profile page - email and name should now display
4. ‚úÖ Test edit functionality - click Edit, modify fields, click Save

## No SQL Changes Needed! ‚úÖ

The Supabase database schema is already correct. The issue was purely in the backend route configuration and frontend API path.
