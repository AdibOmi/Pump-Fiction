### Imports Added
```dart
import '../../../fitness/progress/trackers/tracker_provider.dart';
import '../../../fitness/progress/trackers/tracker_models.dart';
import '../../../fitness/repositories/workout_log_repository.dart';
```

### Class Structure
- **Before:** `ConsumerWidget`
- **After:** `ConsumerStatefulWidget` with `_HomePageState`

### State Variables
- `_workoutRepo`: WorkoutLogRepository instance
- `_hasWorkedOutToday`: Boolean tracking workout completion
- `_isCheckingWorkout`: Boolean for loading state

### New Methods
1. `initState()` - Triggers workout check on page load
2. `_checkTodayWorkout()` - Queries workout logs for today
3. `_calculateSuggestedWeight()` - BMI-based weight calculation
4. `_calculateProteinIntake()` - Protein target calculation
5. `_getCurrentWeightFromTrackers()` - Gets latest weight from tracker
6. `_showUpdateWeightDialog()` - Shows weight update dialog

### UI Changes
1. **Header Card** - Weight now uses tracker data first, then profile fallback
2. **Stats Cards** - Dynamic calculation with tap-to-update on Current card
3. **Habits Section** - Real-time workout tracking and protein calculation

## Data Flow

### Weight Display
1. Check trackers provider for "Body Weight" tracker
2. If found, use latest entry value
3. Fallback to `profile.weightKg`
4. Display as `XX.X kg`

### Weight Update

4. Update `_hasWorkedOutToday` state
5. UI shows checkmark if true

### Protein Calculation
1. Get weight from tracker or profile
2. Calculate: `weight × 2.0g = target`
3. Display: `0/target g (weight × 2.0g)`
4. Current is 0 until nutrition tracking added

## User Experience Flow

### Scenario 1: Update Weight
1. User opens Home page
2. Sees "Current" card with edit icon
3. Taps card
4. Enters new weight (e.g., 70.5)
5. Taps "Save"
6. Dialog closes

2. Returns to Home page
3. "Workout today" shows green checkmark
4. Subtitle says "Completed ✓"

### Scenario 3: Check Protein Target

## Validation & Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [x] Page loads without errors
- [x] Weight updates via dialog
- [x] Tracker created if missing
- [x] Suggested weight displays BMI calculation
- [x] Workout check runs on init
- [x] Checkmark shows if workout logged
- [x] Protein target calculates correctly
- [x] All UI elements render properly
- [x] Loading states work
- [x] Error states handled

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✓ No weight tracker exists → creates one
- ✓ No profile weight → shows "-- kg"
- ✓ No profile height → defaults to 65kg suggested
- ✓ Invalid weight input → shows error snackbar
- ✓ No workouts logged → shows outline icon
- ✓ Zero weight → defaults to 120g protein

## Known Limitations

1. **Nutrition Tracking**: Current protein intake always 0 (requires future feature)
2. **Workout Quick Log**: No quick-add functionality yet
3. **Weight History**: No chart/graph of weight over time
4. **BMI Range**: Only shows single suggested weight, not range

---

## Future Enhancements

### Next Steps
- [ ] Add nutrition logging for actual protein intake
- [ ] Make workout item clickable to quick-log workout
- [ ] Show weight trend (up/down arrow with delta)
- [ ] Add water intake tracker
- [ ] Add sleep quality tracker
- [ ] Show weekly workout streak
- [ ] BMI category indicator (underweight/normal/overweight)

### Technical Improvements
- [ ] Cache workout check result (avoid API call on every load)
- [ ] Debounce weight dialog save (prevent double-tap issues)
- [ ] Add loading skeleton for stats cards
- [ ] Add animations for checkmark state change
